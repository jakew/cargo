# Cargo Example

To renderer, install cargo using `go get -u github.com/jakew/carg`, and then run
`cargo` from the root directory.

If you only want to build one specific manifest, you can name it using
`--manifest` or `-m`. For example:

```shell
cargo -m hello-world
```

This example creates the Dockerfiles in the `dist` folder.
